Once upon a time, in a virtual world on an SSD far, far away, lived a byte.
This byte was no ordinary byte, for he had a special name: !. 

!'s favorite number was 33 (0x21 in HEX), and some of his hobbies are telling others to be opposite of what they are,
and to change themselves to what they weren't before.

One day, an evil Python came along and told ! he was no longer needed in this virtual world,
for in the Python's world, ! didn't exist. ! was then banished back to the old object oriented world from which he
was born in and Python then took over the internet.

Then Ryan realized the stick he saw earlier was indeed python. 

However, ! did not want to just give up so easily. ! knew that he was still needed, that his ability would still be useful to the world.

Because of this realization, ! had to go on a long journey to find his old friend, C. C was a powerful man, sometimes even thought of as a god
by many. After a long journey, ! found C, but C was not what he used to be. So, C had to level up and became C++. ! and C++ then defeated Python
for good and lived happy lives.
